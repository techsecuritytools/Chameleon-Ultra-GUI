# Chameleon Ultra - Web App GUI

The Chameleon Ultra is the ultimate RFID emulation device, offering low and high-frequency emulation, full read & write capabilities, supporting EM410X tags for low frequency (125kHz) and Mifare Classic support for high frequency (13.56MHz). 

# Features

The web app provides an easy way to read, write and save cards in the chameleon ultra slots.

# Getting Started

To get started with the Chameleon Ultra, follow these steps:
 
 -As in for now we still can't install the firmware from the webapp therefore if you just purchased the Chameleon Ultra, you have to install the firmware from the Desktop GUI.
 -Once you have the latest firmware, make sure you are using a browser that supports web serial port, here's a list: https://caniuse.com/web-serial 
 -Connect your Chameleon via USB to the PC, *please note that BLE(bluethoot) is still not supported therefore you will need to connect via the USB.
 -After plugging the Chameleon to the computer simply press the connect button and a pop up will appear. Select the COM port and connect.
 -You can now controle the Chameleon Ultra via the webapp.
